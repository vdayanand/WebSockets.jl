"""
Opens a client, echoes with an optional delay, an integer in milliseconds.
Stores time records for received messages and before sending messages.
Specify the delay in milliseconds by sending a message on the websocket:
    send(ws_jce, "delay|15")
Echoes any message except "exit" and "delay".

Delays to reading, in the websocket use situation, would be caused by usefully spent
calculation time between reads. However, they may be interpreted by the underlying protocol
as transmission problems and cause large slowdowns. Hence the interest in testing
with delays. A countermeasure for optimizing speed might be to run a websocket 
reading function in a parallel, not asyncronous process, putting messages on an internal queue.

At exit or after CLOSEAFTER, this function sends one message containing two vectors of
timestamps [ns].
